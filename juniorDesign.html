								Sponsored by Norwalt Design and Omega Design, the project for this class involved a self contained bottle
								dispensing, filling, and capping device that would fill the bottles with “pills”, represented by BB pellets. The
								goal of this project was that this device should be able to produce 12 completed bottles without any aid. We had a
								large team of 10 students working together on this project, where I was the integrations lead in charge of making
								sure each of the three sub-team's designs would mesh and be programmable in conjunction with one another, as well as
								being a team captain on the pill filling sub-team. I worked very closely with designing chutes with box
								joints attachments to be laser cut as well as a hopper/agitator system that was 3D printed on my personal 3D
								printer. As a TA in my school's design studio, I gained some great experience learning how to create parts
								specifically for laser cutting or specifically for 3D printing, which was a welcomed challenge. I also aided in
								creating parts for each of the other sub-teams to ensure the ease of manufacturability as well as help problem solve
								those areas. Pictured below you can see a holistic image of our design.

								Another one of my responsibilities that I took up for this project was the wiring and programming behind it all. Our
								machine used 5 stepper motors and stepper motor drivers, 2 pairs of break beam sensors/receivers, 1 solenoid, 1
								linear actuator, 2 servo motors, and many buttons for each substation as well as buttons for the machine to start
								and the machine to stop. This was a daunting task with a lot of parts involved, and along with he way I learned a
								lot about soldering wires and crimping wires to put in connector housings. Although the wiring does not look the
								prettiest and could have been more presentable given more time, the job was eventually complete!

								Additionally, the software side of things was another challenge. The traditional way that many examples we were
								referred to operated stepper motors was by using delays to create high and low points as steps and run that many
								times over, but running the system on delays would cause time to be wasted waiting at each station. I was determined
								to find a better answer, and with the help of another design studio TA, I found the correct library to control the
								stepper motors in an efficient manner, as well as a programming technique to create a state machine for my
								operations to live in. This allowed me to create a program that would have multiple events running at once, each
								reporting back when they have finished and updating their task completed count. Once all events have finished, we
								can continue the progress of the conveyor belt until it reaches its next position, then we start the process over
								again.
							</p>
							<p>
								Overall this project was super fun and taught me a lot of skills that I hope to utilize in my professional career.
								Working with the wiring, electronics, programming, and mechanics all for one product was a super rewarding and
								fulfilling experience, and one that I'm eager to do again.
