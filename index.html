    Hello! If you're reading this, welcome to my portfolio! In this website, I'll be showing off 
  all of the interesting things I've done, whether it's for school or just a personal project/hobby 
  (which includes this webpage!). This webpage was made through GitHub Pages, and all of the HTML 
  coding is what I learned along the way!

    So far at the Univerity of Delaware I have done a few small, and one large scale project. 
  They include a project in Statics, Solid Mechanics, Systems Programming, Dynamics, Fluid Mechanics, 
  Heat Transfer, and Machine Design I/II. These range from physical projects to computational projects.
