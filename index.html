    Hello! If you're reading this, welcome to my portfolio! In this website, I'll be showing off all of the interesting things I've done, whether it's for school or just a personal project/hobby (which includes this webpage!). This webpage was made through GitHub Pages, and all of the HTML coding is what I learned along the way!
  </p>

  <br><br><h3>
    School Projects
  </h3>
  
  <br><p>
    So far at the Univerity of Delaware I have done a few small, and one large scale project. They include a project in Statics, Solid Mechanics, Systems Programming, Dynamics, Fluid Mechanics I/II, Heat Transfer, and Machine Design I/II. These range from physical projects to computational projects. I’m really proud of the Machine Design project; you should check that one out!

  <br><h5>
    Statics
  </h5>
  <p>
    A main focus of this course was studying structures to see how they would fare under different loading conditions. To put these skills to good use (and to have a little fun along the way), we were split into teams to make a wooden, foot powered bicycle, with the goal of competing in a race at the end of the semester. My team decided that we would make a design that allowed riders to lean forward and put their feet into little foot rests, almost like a Tron bike. After some 3D modeling, we sent our bike frame over to technicians that operate our universities CNC machine and had our final product. Although we didn’t win the race, we were awarded with the “People’s Choice” award!

  <br><h5>
    Solid Mechanics
  </h5>
  <p>
    This class offered an even deeper dive into studying structures under loading, with specific focus on shear and bending stresses. The project associated with this class involved creating a medical device that would be attached to a patients femur bone in the case of an injury. My team and I created a small plate that would be drilled into a broken bone, and we performed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to test its performance for when it will break. After confirming with the simulation that the plate will withstand the force required, we had the product machined in our machine shop and used an Instron machine to perform a live test.

  <br><h5>
    Dynamics
  </h5>
  <p>
    In this course, we studied forces on objects when they’re moving, generally by deriving the equations of motion for a system. The optional project that was offered in this class was to create a simulation of a rugby ball being launched, and find the difference in its path based on air resistance. Additionally, we were tasked with finding the optimal angle to kick the ball at for the furthest kick, and finding how fast someone would have to run to perform an “up and under” move, where they kick and catch the same ball. I teamed up with my friend Jensen to create a python program to solve these problems.

  <br><h5>
    Fluid Mechanics I
  </h5>
  <p>
    This course introduced me to many different relationships that exist in the fluid mechanics space, and the difficulty of some “unsolvable equations” within the Navier-Stokes equations that are best solved via modeling and finite difference methods. The first project that we had in this class involved creating stream line, path line, etc. plots using python. The other project that we did was performing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis on a part to show how the Navier-Stokes equations could be solve. 
  </p>

<br><h5>
    Fluid Mechanics II
  </h5>
  <p>
    This class focused on more real world applications, so the projects focused on that as well. One project that we did focused on using our kitchen sink to analyze the difference between laminar and turbulent flow with experimental measurements and data analysis. Another project we did was another CFD focused experiment to create a pinewood derby car and use our knowledge of lift and drag to optimize this car and compete with classmates. 
  </p>

  <br><h5>
    Heat Transfer
  </h5>
  <p>
    This class offered another computational project. We were tasked with creating a numerical solution using the finite element method to determine how a plate’s heat would be distributed over time. This was another interesting dive into python and working with looping over lists to generate new data, as well as being able to keep the old data to display certain timestamps or display an animation as new data is generated. 
  </p>

<br><h5>
    Systems Programming
  </h5>
  <p>
    Raspberry pi’s and programming in C were the main technical focus’s in this class. We had a few projects which involved programming our raspberry pi and some programs that were meant to be run in the command prompt. The raspberry pi projects were also offered with a virtual machine because of the lacking availability of raspberry pi’s, but I was luckily able to get one and program on the physical device. It was a really interesting learning experience seeing how we can allocate memory to specific parts of a microcontroller to interact with physical objects. Overall a very interesting course!

  <br><h5>
    Machine Design
  </h5>
  <p>
    Sponsored by Norwalt Design and Omega Design, the project for this class involved a self contained bottle dispensing, filling, and capping device that would fill the bottles with “pills”, represented by BB pellets. The goal of this project was that this device should be able to produce 12 completed bottles without any aid. We had a large team of 10 students working together on this project, where I was the integrations lead in charge of making sure each of the three sub-team’s designs would mesh and be programmable in conjunction with one another, as well as being a team captain on the pill filling sub-team myself. I worked very closely with designing chutes with box joints attachments to be laser cut as well as a hopper/agitator system that was 3D printed on my personal 3D printer. As a TA in my school’s design studio, I gained some great experience learning how to create parts specifically for laser cutting or specifically for 3D printing, which was a welcomed challenge. I also aided in creating parts for each of the other sub-teams to ensure the ease of manufacturability as well as help problem solve those areas. Pictured below you can see a holistic image of our design.

    Another one of my responsibilities that I took up for this project was the wiring and programming behind it all. Our machine used 5 stepper motors and stepper motor drivers, 2 pairs of break beam sensors/receivers, 1 solenoid, 1 linear actuator, 2 servo motors, and many buttons for each substation as well as buttons for the machine to start and the machine to stop. This was a daunting task with a lot of parts involved, and along with he way I learned a lot about soldering wires and crimping wires to put in connector housings. Although the wiring does not look the prettiest and could have been more presentable given more time, the job was eventually complete!

Additionally, the software side of things was another challenge. The traditional way that many examples we were referred to operated stepper motors was by using delays to create high and low points as steps and run that many times over, but running the system on delays would cause time to be wasted waiting at each station. I was determined to find a better answer, and with the help of another design studio TA, I found the correct library to control the stepper motors in an efficient manner, as well as a programming technique to create a state machine for my operations to live in. This allowed me to create a program that would have multiple events running at once, each reporting back when they have finished and updating their task completed count. Once all events have finished, we can continue the progress of the conveyor belt until it reaches its next position, then we start the process over again.

    Overall this project was super fun and taught me a lot of skills that I hope to utilize in my professional career. Working with the wiring, electronics, programming, and mechanics all for one product was a super rewarding and fulfilling experience, and one that I’m eager to do again.
