  <p>
  Hello! If you're reading this, welcome to my portfolio!
  In this website, I'll be showing off all of the interesting
  things I've done, whether it's for school or just a personal
  project/hobby (which includes this webpage!). This webpage was 
  made through GitHub Pages, and all of the HTML coding is what
  I learned along the way!
