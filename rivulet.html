				<h1>RIVULET - Senior Design / Extended Research Project</h1>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/rivulet_image.JPG" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Above is a picture of the most recent edition of the RIVULET, which stands for "Rover for Irrigation
					and Vegetation Understanding, Learning, and Environmental Tracking; additionally, the word 'rivulet'
					is also defined as "a very small stream". This robot, originally devised as a senior design project
					at UD, is intended to be used by farmers/researchers (specifically Dr. Yin Bao, the sponsor of this
					project) to monitor soil moisture and keep track of plant phenotype. Compared to a field drone, 
					which in some cases are used to achieve similar results, this robot achieves locomotion
					by riding along the long trusses of a linear move irrigation system, which connect different
					sections together. Some advantages of this method are a longer battery life, the ability to 
					collect higher precision measurements, and eliminating downwash that drones create from their 
					propellers spinning over crops in the field, which can make image collection impossible due 
					to the crops moving.
				</p>

				<p>The main challenge of developing this robot was avoiding the "truss pockets" - these are the joints
					that connect multiple
					truss rods together. My senior design team and I developed a method of traversing past these by
					having multiple drive wheels
					connected to independent arms, and when a truss pocket is approached, the arm that's movement is
					impacted by the truss pocket
					will lift the wheel out of the way, and the robot is free to continue moving forward. It continues
					this sequence until the
					pocket has been avoided by each wheel, and then it continues with normal operation. My personal
					contribution has been helping
					with manufacturing and design tweaks for mechanical components, researching, and ordering, and
					assembling the electronics, and
					programming the robot to perform its actions.

					The original version has three arms, each independently
					controlled with a linear actuator and their own drive wheel. Each motor (6 total) has their own
					motor driver, which we chose the
					BTS7960. Additionally, we use a counterweight that will shift the CoG depending on which arm lifts
					up, which is belt driven by a
					stepper motor with a TB6600 driver, and a limit switch to home the load. 2 4S lithium ion batteries
					power the system, each with an independent
					capacity of 8 Ah; these were connected in parallel to allow for longer run time. Finally, all of the
					control is driven using an Adafruit Feather
					with a built in LoRa module built in. To communicate between the robot and the controller, we
					created a custom controller that also uses an
					Adafruit Feather, which has a similar look to a classic Nintendo controller.
					<span class="image right"><img src="images/controller.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				</p>

				<p>
					My role as the electronics and programming team member was to test each component for functionality,
					install them onto our robot, and
					create a custom communication protocol between the robot and controller using different bytes in the
					signal to represent information. Through this,
					I expanded upon my proficiency in C++ by learning how to do class-based object oriented coding. That
					code can be found
					<a href="https://github.com/bcaro57/SeniorDesignBot" target="_blank">here</a> on my GitHub page.
					Essentially, I created objects for each component
					(i.e. the drive motor, the actuator, the active balancing, etc.) and separated them into their own
					"controller" objects, which take in the different
					components with the understanding of their placement. Therefore, it was easier to maintain the same
					control between different arms even if something
					changed on the lower level control. Using the RH_RF95 library, I created a data buffer that had
					three bytes of data, which encode data relating to the direction, speed, and
					location which arm should move.
				</p>

				<p>
					Early on, I messed around with the communication in different ways. Because keeping serial prints
					would introduce a lot of unnecessary lag into the system,
					I tested the communication method between the two using push buttons on a controller and LEDs on a
					receiver.

						<source src="images/rivulet-led-example.mp4">
					</video>
				</div>
				</p>

				<p>
					After bug fixing the issues from the communication, I landed on a successful method. Next, we tested
					that same communication scheme with the motors, and
					we added a third button to drive all three motors simultaneously. With this, we confirmed that we
					can implement independent control, which will be handy for moving
					the arms, as well as simultaneous control for the drive wheels.

				<p>
					Now that the proof of concept had been tested out, I was able to move into making the electronics
					more tidy and concise, with mounts to fit them into the frame of our robot.
					At this time, I also helped the other members of my team by laser cutting the arms and any other
					spacers out that we needed in the UD FabLab.

				</div>
				</p>

				<p>
					Eventually, we ordered all of our parts from SendCutSend and were able to assemble the frame and all
					of the electronics. With some final testing and adding the dynamic balancer, I
					was able to create an initial setup routine and specialized moves for each arm to raise and lower,
					while placing the balance weight accordingly. The video below shows this process at 2.5x speed.

					My group presented this at UD's annual design showcase, where all seniors present their senior
					design projects. We created a frame that was representative of the truss rod that the
					robot would have to travel along during normal operation, and we also were able to bring it to a
					farm site on campus and put it on to run it. In the end, this design ended up proving
					to be a great validation of the idea, and a partner and I were offered by Dr. Bao to work on this
					project again in the coming semester to make some general improvements based on
					these initial results.

				<p>
					During the next semester, my teammate and I decided that it would be best to restart the robot
					from scratch, taking the lessons learned and the new understanding of both the scope and the 
					problem to make better informed decisions for the design. The major design constraints revolved
					around reducing the total weight of the robot, which meant finding a different method for 
					self-stabilization, changing the type of battery power, and reducing the size all while 
					introducing a sleek new look.
				</p>

				<p> 
					In order to start, we needed to think about what worked well and what didn't. One major feature 
					that we intentionally thought of for the previous version was using V-groove wheels; this would 
					allow the robot to dynamically compensate for the rod if the placement was off, simply sliding
					back into place. We wanted to keep that same design, but try to optimize the size of the wheel,
					meaning we we're going to have to create something custom. The approach that we decided on was
					creating a 3D model of the wheel, casting a negative mold in silicone, and then creating a final
					positive mold of the wheel with a central machined hub being trapped inside of the new wheel. 
					This is to ensure that the drive shaft can have a metal interface to interact with rather than
					some resin. I equate this to the idea of "borrowing tolerances" that is commonly referred to
					in the 3D printing community.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another feature that we knew didn't work well in our new design was the counterweight system.
					To combat this problem, we created a new arm model that had an "up-stop wheel". This wheel 
					supports the robot from the underneath, and it is actuated via a timing belt with custom
					3d printed timing pulleys. With that, we can precisely control the amount of relative 
					rotation that the up-stop wheel should have in comparison to the drive wheel. This wheel
					will similarly have an insert into its core, but this will be a stock part that can be
					press fit in rather than trapping the hardware inside the resin.
