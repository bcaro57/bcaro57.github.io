							<h1>RIVULET - Senior Design / Extended Research Project</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/rivulet_image.JPG" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Above is a picture of the most recent edition of the RIVULET, which stands for "Rover for Irrigation and 
								Vegitation Understanding, Learning, and Environmental Tracking. Rivulet also is defined as "a very small stream". 
								This robot, originially devised as a senior design project at UD, is intended to be used by farmers/researchers 
								(specifically Dr. Yin Bao, the sponsor of this project) to monitor soil moisture and keep track of plant phenotype.
								Compared to a field drone, which in some cases are used to achieve similar results, this robot achieves locomotion 
								by riding along the long trusses of a linear move irrigation system, which connect different sections together.
								Some advantages of this method are a longer battery life, the ability to collect higher precision measurements, and 
								elimintaing downwash that drones create from their propellers spinning over crops in the field, which can make image 
								collection impossible due to the crops moving. 
							</p>

							<p>The main challenge of developing this robot was avoiding the "truss pockets" - these are the joints that connect multiple
								truss rods together. My senior design team and I developed a method of traversing past these by having multiple drive wheels
								connected to independent arms, and when a truss pocket is approached, the arm that's movement is impacted by the truss pocket
								will lift the wheel out of the way, and the robot is free to continue moving forward. It continues this sequence until the 
								pocket has been avoided by each wheel, and then it continues with normal operation. My personal contribution has been helping
								with manufacturing and design tweaks for mechanical components, researching, and ordering, and assembling the electronics, and 
								programming the robot to perform its actions.
							</p>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/cad rivulet v1.jpg" alt="" /></span>The original version has three arms, each independently 
								controlled with a linear actuator and their own drive wheel. Each motor (6 total) has their own motor driver, which we chose the 
								BTS7960. Additionally (not pictured), we use a counterweight that will shift the CoG depending on which arm lifts up, which is belt driven by a 
								stepper motor with a TB6600 driver, and a limit switch to home the load. Finally, all of the control is driven using an Adafruit Feather
								with a built in LoRa module built in. To communicate between the robot and the controller, we created a custom controller that also uses an Adafruit
								Feather, which has a similar look to a classic Nintendo controller.
