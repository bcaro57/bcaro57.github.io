							<h1>Swarm Simulator</h1>

							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/swarm sim cover.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								In Fall 2024, my first year of the 4+1 graduate program, I participated in this swarm simulator project
								as an independent study. The aim of this project was to help two PhD students in the lab by creating a 
								simulated environment to run their swarm experiments on. The current setup used physical robots, each 
								with a unique arrangement of motion capture balls to determine the robots transformation matrix relative
								to the world, and control it by monitoring this matrix. A few drawbacks that occur with this experimentation
								method are the limited battery life of the robots and the amount of time that it takes for an experiment to
								run. To train the machine learning models that they have planned, this current setup is inadequate because of
								the long time that it takes to run; thus, this project was devised to help productivity for these students.
							</p>
							<p>This project uses ROS2 Humble and Gazebo Classic, both of which were somewhat new to me coming into this project.
								I had previously created a URDF (3d robot description) file, and very trivial simulations in class project for fun.
								Here, however, I needed to dive deeper to learn about controlling the robots independently in a simulated environment,
								and developing code that would control allow them to operate within the world coordinate frame. I found the dimensions
								(in the left picture below) through the producer and used them to create the 3d model (in the right picture below).
								To do this, I created a URDF file, which is made up of tags similar to HTML. Each robot is made of joints and links,
								where the joints are connecting two links, and the links describe the visual geometry, collision geometry, and inertial
								geometry of a given linkage. In this case, each wheel is its own link and the chassis is one link, and each wheel is
								joined to the chassis. Additional to these robots, I had to create the arena which mimics the mat in the lab. It has some small thickness, and
								matches the dimensions of its real life counterpart.

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/turbopi model.png" height="400" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
							<p>The next task was to create some control for the robots. The first task that I decided to go with was developing my own controller
								based on the teleoperation function that already exists in ROS2. Below, you can see one robot in the arena, as well as 
								the commands in the terminal to pull up the teleoperation function.

								</video>
							</div>
							<p>Now, in order to actually control the robots, the transformation matrices for each robot must be read and used by our
								program to determine heading and location. In the following video, you're able to see the transformation data change 
								when I drive the robot around.

								</video>
							</div>
							<p>Finally, you can see the example below. This uses a PID controller for each robot, which spawns in a random orientation
								within a small radius, similar to the real life experiment. Each robot has its own predetermined location that it is supposed
								to travel to within the world frame, spaced 0.5m apart. Although the robot controller could use more tuning, the product undeniably
								matches with what the real world experiments are capable of doing.

							</div>
							<p>This project taught me a lot about ROS2 and how to control mobile robots in a simulation environment, as well as how to use
								transformation matrices from each robot. One very challenging aspect of this project was developing independent control
								of each robot, which through a lot of trial and error as well as reading documentation and finding useful code online
								eventually helped solve my problem. This project was very rewarding, and I'm excited to work more and expand my knowledge of
								ROS2! If you'd like to see the code, you can find it
